1. Evaluate tonal cohesion by determining whether the emotional mood conveyed by the lighting and the emotional mood conveyed by the setting agree with one another. Assess whether the quality of the light — its warmth or coolness, its softness or harshness — tells the same story as the environment it falls across. A photograph achieves tonal cohesion when the light and the setting speak with one voice, producing a single, unified atmosphere rather than contradictory impressions. Score this quality low when the light suggests one mood while the space suggests another, creating an internal tension that fractures the image along that fault line.

2. Evaluate chromatic sympathy by determining whether the colors present in the environment work with, rather than against, the natural coloring of the cat. Assess whether the palette of the scene accommodates the cat gracefully — through harmonious echoes, gentle contrasts, or complementary relationships — rather than overwhelming it or rendering it a visual orphan. This is not a question of whether individual colors are beautiful, but whether the cat and its surroundings participate in a coherent color scheme. Score this quality low when the color palette is so disjointed or overpowering that the cat's presence is diminished, lost in a chromatic argument that has nothing to do with it.

3. Evaluate spatial belonging by determining the degree to which the cat looks like it genuinely inhabits and belongs within the environment shown in the photograph. Assess whether the cat and its surroundings feel like they are part of the same moment and the same world, or whether the image takes on a composite quality where the cat appears to float in front of its background rather than exist within it. Consider whether the scale, depth, textures, and visual weight feel consistent across the entire frame. Score this quality low when there is any sense of collage or assembly — when the viewer feels, even subtly, that the cat and its environment were brought together rather than discovered together.
